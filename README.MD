## Python script to download all Springer books released for free during the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine
![Python package and testrun](https://github.com/alexgand/springer_free_books/workflows/Python%20package%20and%20testrun/badge.svg)
### Books available
It used to have 409 english books (it took about 4 hours to complete the download ~ 14 GB, both PDF and EPUB, on my machine), but Springer has since removed some of them from the open access.

### Usage
**Note**: If you want just one or two specific books, get [the excel file](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/17858272/data/) and manually download those or use the script to help you download (see **Download book selectively** sub-section).

By default the script stores the books in `./downloads` subfolder according to the subject ("English Package Name" column of the excel file).

#### Download all English books (PDF and EPUB)
Use the following command to download all PDF and EPUB books to the default download folder `./downloads`
```bash
python3 main.py
```
To download them to a subfolder of your choice, say `books`
```bash
python3 main.py -f ./books
```
You can download to an absolute path, say `C:/ebooks/springer/`
```bash
python3 main.py -f C:/ebooks/springer/
```
Parallel downloading, say with 3 jobs, can be enabled with
```bash
python3 main.py -j 3
```

### Download all German books (PDF and EPUB)
To download the German books use
```bash
python3 main.py --lang de
```
This language flag can be combined with any of the above and below mentioned options. If not specified, `--lang en`, i.e. English, is
the default.

#### Download all books of specific format
To download all PDF books only, run
```bash
python3 main.py --pdf
```
or all EPUB books only
```bash
python3 main.py --epub
```

#### Download only specific book categories
You can download selective books by categories. Make sure category name with space(s) is enclosed in double quotation marks,  like so
```bash
python3 main.py -c Engineering "CoMpuTer sciEnCe"
```
The category name is case-insensitive.

#### Download book selectively
You can download books by indices (refer to the excel file for the titles)
```bash
python3 main.py -i 2 345 70 90 0 213
```

#### Verbose mode
If you need to know what you are downloading, enable the verbose mode with `-v` option
```bash
python3 main.py -v -c "Behavioral science and psychology" "chaos AD" UFO "Life science" -i 2 34 400
```
You will get the following summary before the downloading starts
```

source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

### Virtual environment on Windows (auto-detects Python version):
Just double-click the `run_VirtualEnv.bat` file from Windows Explorer, or type-in its name at the command-line and press ENTER.
Do install Python first, either from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
or from the [Microsoft Store for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search?q=python).

### Virtual environment on Windows (Python 3.x):
```winbatch
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Virtual environment on Windows (Python 2.7.x):
```winbatch
python -m virtualenv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Thanks Springer!

## Docker container to do all the work

Considering you cloned the repo in a folder, as:
```bash
cd \home\[user]\workspace
git clone https://github.com/alexgand/springer_free_books.git
cd springer_free_books
mkdir downloads
```

You can run the scripts like that:
```bash
docker build . -t springer-image
docker run --rm -v [local_download_folder]:/app/downloads springer-image
```
and the downloads will be at [`local_download_folder`].

## Troubleshooting
On macOS, if the script produces a `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` error, then security certificates may need to be installed. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50236117/scraping-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-error-for-http-en-wikipedia-org). If that doesn't work, see alternate instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44649449/brew-installation-of-python-3-6-1-ssl-certificate-verify-failed-certificate/44649450#44649450).
